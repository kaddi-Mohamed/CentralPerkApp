Project Title
Description
This application consists of a backend API and a frontend interface. The backend is built using Spring Boot and handles image storage directly on the file system. The frontend, built with React, requires specific environment configurations for proper API communication.

Prerequisites
Java 11+ for the backend
Node.js and npm for the frontend
Docker Desktop (optional, if using Dockerized MySQL setup)
Backend Setup
Configure the Image Storage Path:

The backend API saves images to the file system. To correctly set up this storage, open the application.properties file in the backend and update the file.storage.path with the desired path where you want images to be saved.
Example:
properties
Copy code
file.storage.path=/your/desired/storage/path
Ensure that the specified directory exists and is writable by the application.
Start the Backend:

Run the backend application by executing:
bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
This will start the backend API, which will be accessible at the configured base URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Frontend Setup
Create .env file:

In the root directory of the frontend, create a .env file.
Add the following line to the .env file, replacing your_backend_base_url with the actual base URL of your backend (e.g., http://localhost:8080):
plaintext
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=your_backend_base_url
Install Dependencies and Start the Frontend:

Install the necessary dependencies by running:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend application:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will now be configured to communicate with the backend.
Additional Notes
Make sure that both the backend and frontend are running simultaneously for proper interaction.
When deploying, ensure that both the backend path for image storage and the frontend .env configuration are updated according to the production environment.
